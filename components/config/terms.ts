Company is not responsible if the Linked Site is not working correctly or for any viruses, malware, or other harms resulting from User’s use of a Linked Site. Company is providing these links to User only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Company of the site or any association with its operators. User is responsible for viewing and abiding by the privacy policies and terms of use posted on the Linked Sites. User is solely responsible for any dealings with third parties who support Company or are identified on the Website, including any delivery of and payment for goods and services. Company does not store any information shared with a Linked Site and is not responsible for any personally identifiable information shared with any Linked Site. Third-Party Smart Contracts. User acknowledges and understands that Company uses certain third-party Smart Contracts that it has no ownership of, or control over, which are core components of the Platform. Company is not responsible for any coding errors, glitches, or any functionality, or lack thereof, of such third-party Smart Contracts.  Release. To the fullest extent permitted by law, User hereby releases and forever discharges Company (and its Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waives and relinquishes, each and every past, present, and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or that relates directly or indirectly to, the Platform (including any interactions with, or act or omission of, Company’s partners or any other third-party or any Linked Sites).

The Platform is a fully decentralized liquidity lending protocol. The Platform allows Users to borrow assets from the Platform by using validator-backed assets as collateral without requiring Users to sacrifice the staking yield being accrued to those validator-backed assets. Similarly, the Platform will provide liquidity to Users who deposit their liquid re-staking tokens into the Platform while retaining their exposure to diverse sets of staking yield originating from actively validated services. The Website is provided for Users to access the Platform, use the Service, and to provide updates about the Ion Ecosystem to Users.  Website Content. Company does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this information at any particular time for any particular purpose. Any reliance User places on such information is strictly at User’s own risk. Company disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such content by User, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents. Use of the Website, Platform and Service; Licenses. Subject to this Agreement, Company grants User a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and use the Platform, including the Website and the data, material, content, or information herein (collectively, the “Content”) solely for User’s personal use. User’s right to access and use the same shall be limited to the purposes described in these Terms unless User is otherwise expressly authorized by Company, in writing, to use the Platform for User’s own commercial purposes. User agrees to use the Platform only for lawful purposes, comply with all rules governing any transactions on and through the Platform and comply with the law. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved, and no license or right to use any trademark of Company or any third-party is granted to User. Additional Considerations Transactions Are Recorded on Public Blockchains. The transactions that take place on the Platform are managed and confirmed via public Blockchains. User understands that its Wallet address will be made publicly visible whenever it engages in a transaction on the Platform. Company does not own or control any Blockchain that Company chooses to interface with, or any other third-party site, product, or service that User might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling User to access and utilize the various features of the Platform. Company is not liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, and will not be liable for any damage that a User may suffer as a result of its transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties. Gas. All transactions on the Platform are facilitated by Smart Contracts. Public Blockchains require the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on its network, and thus every transaction occurring on the Platform.  The value of the Gas Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely outside of the control of Company or the Platform. User acknowledges that under no circumstances will a transaction on the Platform be invalidated, revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Gas Fee for the given transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to User.

DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT COMPLIANCE Notification. Company takes claims of copyright and/or trademark infringement seriously.

Upon removing any allegedly infringing material, Company will notify the alleged infringer of such takedown. Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability. Counter Notification. If User elects to send Company’s copyright agent a counter notice, to be effective it must be a written communication that includes the following (please consult User’s legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(g)(3) to confirm these requirements): a physical or electronic signature; identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; a statement under penalty of perjury that the User has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; adequate information by which Company can contact User, including User’s name, address, and telephone number; and a statement that the User consents to the jurisdiction of a federal district court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the User’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Company may be found, and that the User will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person. The DMCA allows Company to restore the removed content if the party filing the original DMCA Notice does not file a court action against User within ten (10) Business Days of receiving the copy of its counter notice. Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability. Company’s designated copyright agent or authorized official to receive notifications and counter-notifications of claimed infringement is: Ion Protocol, Inc.  Email: support@ionprotocol.io A summary of the DMCA can be obtained from the U.S. Copyright Office.  INDEMNIFICATION User agrees to release, indemnify, and hold harmless Company and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to: (a) User’s access to, use of, or inability to use the Platform, the Website, or Service; (b) User’s breach of this Agreement; (c) User’s violation of any rights of a third party; (d) User’s violation of any Applicable Law; and (e) any and all financial losses User may suffer, or cause others to suffer, due to utilizing, transferring, staking, or re-staking cryptocurrency, or any other digital assets. ASSUMPTION OF RISK User Acknowledges the Risk of Cryptocurrency and Smart Contracts. USER REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT UNDERSTANDS AND IS WILLING TO ACCEPT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS SUCH AS SMART CONTRACTS, PUBLIC BLOCKCHAINS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN), LIQUIDITY PROTOCOLS, AND THE INTERPLANETARY FILE SYSTEM. Company is Not Responsible for Technical Errors on Any Blockchain. COMPANY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES ARISING FROM THE USE OF BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OF ANY BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK OR WALLET THAT COMPANY OR USER MAY INTERFACE WITH, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH A BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK OR ANY ASSOCIATED LAYER 2 BLOCKCHAINS THAT COMPANY OR USER MAY INTERFACE WITH, INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES, OR ANY OTHER ISSUES RESULTING IN LOSS OF FUNDS. User Acknowledges the Risks of Using its Staked and Re-Staked Assets as Collateral.  User acknowledges that it will have to supply validator-backed assets as collateral in order to borrow assets from the Platform. By using the Services and the Platform, in the event that the value of User’s liabilities exceeds the value of the User’s collateral, User represents and warrants that it understands that the Platform can liquidate the digital assets which User provided as collateral (a “Liquidation Event”). A Liquidation Event will likely cause User to lose all the collateral User provided to the Platform. User acknowledges that the risk of a Liquidation Event is inherent to the Platform and can happen at any time given the volatility of digital assets. User further acknowledges that Company and its Affiliates are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, cannot control the value of digital assets or User’s collateral, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that User experiences while accessing or using the Platform. Accordingly, User understands and agrees to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Platform and interacting with the Platform. User Acknowledges the Risks of the Platform. User acknowledges that the Platform is subject to flaws and that User is solely responsible for evaluating any information provided by the Platform. This warning and others provided in this Agreement by Company in no way evidence or represent an ongoing duty to alert User to all of the potential risks of utilizing or accessing the Platform. The Platform may experience sophisticated cyber-attacks, cryptocurrency based economic exploits, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions to or delays on the Platform. User agrees to accept the risk of the Platform failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks, and User agrees that it will not hold Company accountable for any related losses. Company will not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any viruses that may affect User’s computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack.  Company Does Not Make Any Representations Regarding the Value of Cryptocurrency or Other Digital Assets. The prices of Blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of cryptocurrency, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development, potential utility, or value of cryptocurrency. The Ion Ecosystem and other digital assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions. For all of the foregoing reasons, as well as for reasons that may not presently be known to Company, Company makes absolutely no representations or warranties of any kind regarding the value of cryptocurrency or other digital assets. User Acknowledges Financial Risk of Digital Assets. The risk of loss associated with the use of digital assets can be substantial. User should, therefore, carefully consider whether creating, buying, selling, or otherwise using digital assets is suitable for User in light of its circumstances and financial resources. By using the Platform, accessing the Website, and/or purchasing cryptocurrency, User represents that it has been, is and will be solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying digital assets. User represents that it has sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make its own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted via any digital asset. Under no circumstances will the operation of all or any portion of the Platform be deemed to create a relationship that includes the provision or tendering of investment advice.  Company is Not Responsible for Losses Due to Jurisdictional Blocks. User acknowledges that Company has no control over jurisdictional blocks which may prevent User from utilizing the Website. Under no circumstances will Company be liable for User’s inability to access the Website due to a jurisdictional block. Violations by Other Users. User irrevocably releases, acquits, and forever discharges Company and its subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers, and successors for and against any and all past or future causes of action, suits, or controversies arising out of another User’s violation of these Terms. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY (OR COMPANY’S AFFILIATES) BE LIABLE TO USER OR ANY THIRD-PARTY FOR ANY FINANCIAL LOSS, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR USER’S USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE PLATFORM, THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICE, CONTENT OR INFORMATION ACCESSED VIA THE WEBSITE OR ANY HYPERLINKED WEBSITE, OR ANY DISRUPTION OR DELAY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE WEBSITE, THE PLATFORM, OR THE SERVICE EVEN IF COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

USER’S SOLE REMEDY AGAINST COMPANY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE WEBSITE, THE PLATFORM, OR THE CONTENT IS TO CEASE ITS USE OF THE PLATFORM AND THE WEBSITE.

Arbitration will be conducted and administered by the Center for Conciliation and Arbitration of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries, and Agriculture of Panama (“CeCAP”) and its dispute resolution rules (“CeCAP Rules”), as modified by these Terms. The CeCAP rules are available online at https://cecap.com.pa/en/reglamento-de-cecap/, or by contacting Company. A single arbitrator will be appointed unless otherwise required by the CeCAP rules. Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the specific relief requested. A Notice to Company should be sent by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) to: Ion Protocol, Inc.  Craigmuir Chambers Road Town, Tortola, VG 1110 British Virgin Islands User must send a courtesy copy of a Notice to Company at support@ionprotocol.io. Company may send User a Notice by electronic mail if User has provided Company with such an address. Company may also provide Notice to User’s Wallet by sending an NFT to User’s Wallet. After the Notice is received, User and Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If User and Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. Fees; Location. Each party shall be responsible for the payment of its own fees and costs associated with an arbitration, except as otherwise required by the CeCAP Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place in Panama City, Panama, or another location mutually agreed upon by the parties; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties shall endeavor, where possible, to cause the arbitration proceeding to be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; or (ii) through a non-appearance-based telephone hearing or videoconference. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of User’s claim or the relief sought in User’s arbitration demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, in the arbitrator’s reasonable discretion, then the payment of all arbitration fees will be governed by the CeCAP Rules. In that case, User agrees to reimburse Company for all monies previously disbursed by Company that are otherwise User’s obligation to pay under the CeCAP Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party will be responsible for their own attorneys’ fees associated with an arbitration under these Terms, and in no event may the arbitrator award any party their attorneys’ fees. Enforcement. The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction with respect to this section to compel arbitration, to confirm an arbitration award or order, or to handle court functions permitted under the CeCAP Rules. The parties irrevocably waive defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or other proceeding. The parties may seek recognition and enforcement of any court judgment confirming an arbitration award or order in any court having jurisdiction with respect to recognition or enforcement of such judgment. Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between User and Company in any court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, USER AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.  Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. 30-Day Right to Opt Out. User has the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of its decision to opt out within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. User’s notice must include its name and address, its Wallet address, and an unequivocal statement that User desires to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If User opts out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to User. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that User may currently have, or may enter in the future, with Company. Mail written notification by certified mail to: Ion Protocol, Inc.  Craigmuir Chambers Road Town, Tortola, VG 1110 British Virgin Islands Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.  Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. In the event a party files an action in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section 14.5(b), the party found to be the substantially losing party in any dispute shall be required to pay the reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of any party determined to be the substantially prevailing party. In the context of this Agreement, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs shall include but not be limited to legal fees and costs, the fees and costs of witnesses, accountants, experts, and other professionals, and any other forum costs incurred during, or in preparation for, a dispute. It is understood that certain time entries that may appear in the billing records of such party’s legal counsel may be redacted to protect attorney-client or work-product privilege, and this will not prevent recovery for the associated billings. Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any person, other than the parties and their successors and permitted assigns, any of the rights hereunder. No Support or Maintenance. User acknowledges and agrees that Company will have no obligation to provide User with any support or maintenance in connection with the Platform, Website, or Service.
