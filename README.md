# Ion Yield Bridge

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Environment Setup

To set up the environment variables, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

For development, you will need a Wallet Connect project ID and a Tenderly RPC URL (which an admin can provide).

## Node.js Version

Ensure you have Node.js version 20.12.2 or greater installed. You can check your Node.js version with:

```bash
node -v
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
